// INTERFACES

// Interfaces are a simplification of types
// Interfaces are used when a type is needed for one file, while types can be accessed from all project
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// 1. Create a constant person object with name 'Mary' and age 25


// 2. Create a function that logs a the person's name and age - using the Person as type

// 3. Use the function to log Mary's details

// 4. Modify the above code to add gender to the interface person with a list of possible genders and fix all errors
